            <p>Harry Potter is my favorite character because I absolutely love the whole Harry Potter series!<br>I could say that I love all of the characters from the series, but I pick Harry Potter because he is the main character in the stories.<br> I like Harry Potter because of his loyal personality and bravery. His role throughout the stories is just exceptional!<br> He is always up to do anything for his friends even if it is risking his life against the evil.<br> Harry Potter is also a Gryfindor which mathces my house. <br> All in all, Harry Potter is my favorite character in the Harry Potter series.</p>
